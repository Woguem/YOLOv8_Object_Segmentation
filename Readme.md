This code implements a complete YOLOv8 segmentation pipeline, training a model to generate object masks and performing inference on both static images (from files or web URLs) and real-time video streams (webcam or video files). It advanced visualization with contour overlays, and automatic saving of segmentation results, providing an end-to-end solution for instance segmentation tasks.
